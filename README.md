# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
# Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data. Detecting fraudulent activities is crucial in maintaining the integrity of financial systems and protecting both customers and financial institutions from unauthorized transactions.
# Dataset:
The project will utilize a dataset containing credit card transactions, with features such as transaction amount, timestamp, location, and other relevant information. This dataset will include labeled instances indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The data will be carefully processed to handle class imbalance, missing values, and ensure the quality of the input.
# Technologies:
The project will be implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. Jupyter Notebooks may be used for interactive development, and the model may be deployed using frameworks suitable for real-time applications.
# Expected Outcome:
The outcome of this project is an effective credit card fraud detection model capable of identifying potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time. The model's performance will be rigorously evaluated, and the project will be well-documented to facilitate integration into financial systems and ongoing maintenance.
